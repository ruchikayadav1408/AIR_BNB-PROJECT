We have created a website using EJS, MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js (MERN stack) for both frontend and backend. The website allows users to create a list of resorts, beaches, and other destinations along with their details. Users can add, edit, and delete items in their own lists. However, a user cannot edit or delete items in another user's list.

The website also features a review system where users can leave comments. The user who left the comment has the ability to delete their own comment.

For user management, we have implemented authentication and authorization using sign up and login functionalities.
<BR>
We have followed the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, separating concerns between the data (Model), presentation (View), and application logic (Controller).

To maintain user sessions, we are using session IDs. Cookies are also utilized for managing user sessions across multiple requests.

Overall, our website provides a secure and user-friendly platform for creating, managing, and reviewing destination lists, ensuring that each user's data remains private and accessible only to them.
